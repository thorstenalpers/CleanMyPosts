## ℹ️ About Browser Automation

CleanMyPosts uses **browser automation** to perform bulk actions—such as deleting posts, likes, and unfollowing accounts—on your X (formerly Twitter) profile.  
This method is used because X currently does **not offer an official feature or API** for these actions.

Please keep in mind:
- While convenient, browser automation may **not fully comply** with X’s Terms of Service.  
- All operations are performed in your own logged-in browser session—**no credentials are stored**.
- Since browser automation mimics real user interactions, these actions are typically **indistinguishable from manual activity**, reducing the risk of detection.
