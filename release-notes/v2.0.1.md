### What's Changed

- **Fixed Bug in Repost Deletion Retry Loop**  
  Improved handling of reposts where the deletion loop could appear to hang. The retry count has been reduced from 5 to 3 to prevent perceived infinite loops when a repost cannot be removed.  
  ðŸ‘‰ *Tip: Delete your original posts first before cleaning up reposts to avoid mixed-content issues.*

- **Fixed Documentation Bug in `DeleteAllReplies` Example**  
  The example for `DeleteAllReplies` was missing the required `username` parameter, causing the script to fail. The corrected usage is:  
  ```js
  DeleteAllReplies('your_username', 1000, 5);
